The three of us live in a high-rise estate, in a cosy two-bedroom flat that has become our home despite its high-rise image.I got married in 2016 and became a father in 2021 - two formative milestones in my life.I recently joined the DRV Bund as a test developer in Team F and am looking forward to getting to know you and the work here better.",

My focus was on converting an ERP system for medium-sized companies into a mobile application.</p><p>Before joining the DRV Bund, I worked at Toll Collect as a software developer and test automation engineer - an exciting period in which I was able to further expand and deepen my technical expertise.</p>",
